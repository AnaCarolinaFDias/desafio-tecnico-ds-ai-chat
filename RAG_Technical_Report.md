## **1. Introduction**
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a cutting-edge method that combines retrieval-based approaches with generative models to enhance performance on various tasks. This report compares two RAG methods: a simple baseline and a custom method.

Key objectives:
- Compare the effectiveness of the baseline RAG method with an advanced custom method.
- Evaluate results based on retrieval quality, generation accuracy, and overall system performance.
