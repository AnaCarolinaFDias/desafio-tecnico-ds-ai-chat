Burlington Labs has treated these pants evenly with permethrin, a synthetic form of a naturally occurring bug repellent, allowing you to stay free of insects. The pants are made with 100% polyester, and feature a semielastic waistband with nylon web belt, UPF 50+ protection, and seven pockets, including zippered cargo, rear, and security pockets. Additionally, the permethrin is still effective even after 70 washes, and the fabric is quick-drying and moisture-wicking. Plus, the legs can be zipped off to convert the pants into shorts.
